Info: Shaders mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 updated to include more features, like dynamic shadows.

Previously known as just GLSL shaders.

### Common Error
There is no way to disable the following error:

```
########## GL ERROR ##########
@ Post render
1282: Invalid operation
```

A future modder will need to turn off OpenGL errors for it to go away.
This is easier said than done. Hence, it hasn't been done yet.
